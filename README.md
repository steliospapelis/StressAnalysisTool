normalizes the stress values based on calm and stressed intervals,  
and extracts key features for further analysis.

The output includes normalized data and aggregated metrics saved in JSON format.

Includes an inituitive UI to add and manage participants, overview their data in graph visualizations and output processed data for statistical analysis.
